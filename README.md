# Workshop - Satellite Data Analysis for Urban Expansion with Python

The repository for remote sensing - land use training - Data Analysis Workshop at Nancy, France

<br>

The workshop introduces breif fundamental of remote sensing data analysis in order to geographically and scientifically discover urban expansion using satallite data. Learning resources are Google Colab - based to prompt to run and interactively explore how to data analysis handling. Outcome of the workshop results web-based application embeded to HTML ready-to-publish product of analysis results.
